# updir
Serve static files from a directory

### Install
If you have `GO` installed in your system you can run

```bash
go install github.com/isgj/updir
```

Or in https://github.com/isgj/updir/releases you can find builds for Linux x86_64 machines

### Why?

Just for fun.

Probably you will use (or your preferred one)
```bash
python -m http.serve
```
